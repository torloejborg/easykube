== Background

Easykube started out as a collection of Gradle build scripts. The primary use case was to enable mobile developers to install real backends locally, allowing them to work offline and not require a personal instance of some test system on a random cluster, incurring a real monetary cost.

Our mobile developers fancy MacBooks were powerful enough to drive a small Kubernetes instance, even with multiple backends. So why have their machines sit idle?

Later, easykube was reimplemented in Go. And here we are :)
