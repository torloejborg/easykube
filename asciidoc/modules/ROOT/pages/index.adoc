== History
Easykube started out as collection of gradle build files. The primary use-case was to enable mobile developers to install real backends locally, enabling then to work offline and not require a personal instance of a test system on some random cluster.

Those fancy macbooks were powerful enough to drive a small kubernetes instance, even with multiple backends.

Later easykube was reimplemented in go-lang.
