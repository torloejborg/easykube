Use Nix to get all the tools you need for development.
The Nix flake provides three shell variants:

* default
* light
* docs

== Default

First, make sure you have Nix installed; this is described xref:install.adoc#install-nix[here].

Then clone the repository. The default shell will set everything up and compile easykube. However, this can get tedious during development, so it is recommended to use the *light* variant instead.

== Light

`nix develop .#light`

This creates a shell with all the tools needed for building and testing.

== Docs

Another shell is available on the `docs` branch. This branch is dedicated to writing documentation and comes with an additional set of tools.

`nix develop .#docs`

Currently, no GitHub Actions workflow is set up to generate and publish documentation. This means the workflow is semi-manual, which is useful because you can review the results before publishing.

We use Asciidoctor and Antora to write and generate the static documentation site.

Generate the documentation with:

`make docs` — The output is generated into the `/docs` directory.

Then commit, push, and create a PR.
